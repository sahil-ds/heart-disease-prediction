# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Therefore, it is now more important than ever to prevent heart disorders. In order to ensure that more people may live healthy lives, effective data-driven methods for predicting cardiac diseases can enhance the overall research and prevention process. Machine learning is useful in this situation. The heart diseases are predicted with the use of machine learning, and the forecasts are fairly accurate.

The project involved the proper data processing and analysis of the patient dataset for heart disease. Following that, many models were trained, and various methods were used to make predictions. KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression are some examples.This is the dataset and Jupyter notebook code I used for my project.

I've utilized a variety of Python-based Machine Learning algorithms to determine whether a patient has cardiac disease. This classification issue predicts whether or not heart disease is present by using a range of characteristics as input features and a binary variable as the target variable.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
